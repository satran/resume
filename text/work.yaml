  summary: Building a payment gateway using a micro-service architecture and Go 

  keywords: [go, micro-services, kafka, event-sourcing]

  detailed: I started with the company right from the beginning. We work as a very democratic team all reporting to the CTO. I was involved in architecting the whole platform as a micro-service based system. I was also involved in building a book-keeping solution and worked very closely with the accounting department. We use Go, Kafka and Postgres to name just a few of the technologies. One of the very interesting thing we did was to use event sourcing. This is both a bane and boon. Tracing what went wrong is a lot simpler but with it comes complexity in various other places.

  summary: Led a team to develop an Intelligent Character Recognition System.   

  keywords: [C, Python, JavaScript, MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ]

  detailed: We developed an Intelligent Character Recognition System. The application had two parts, the user facing end was written using HTML5 and the image recognition and intelligent correction was done using C, C++ and Python. I led the team to build a distributed and flexible system. With the inherent shortcomings of Python for distributed systems we sought refuge in RabbitMQ for queuing and C, C++ for speed. Intelligent correction is one important area in this project and I created a very robust and intelligent word correction system in C using Tokyo Cabinet as the backend database. MongoDB, Redis, PostgreSQL were the databases used for the system. I also architected the user facing application built with JavaScript and Backbone.js.

  summary: Architect and built a School Management System

  keywords: [Python, MySQL, PHP, Networking]

  detailed: I joined the School to help computerise manual processes. I transformed a system using MS Excel and MS Word to a web application which could serve multiple users and that could be accessed remotely. Here I built the network and servers that would be used by the application. I also configured a Network file sharing system using Samba, a Firewall using iptables, DHCP servers, fault tolerant servers using RAID. All the servers were running on GNU/Linux. The in house application was an ERP solution to manage students and staff. It also provided analysis of student grades and automation of many processes. I started with Perl, moved to PHP and eventually to Python.
